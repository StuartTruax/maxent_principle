# Maximum Entropy Principle: From Statistical Mechanics to Machine Learning Models 

Stuart Truax, 2025-08-1

## Abstract


This repo is a set of slides I composed and presented in the latter half of 2025. Maximum entopy distributions are model  distributions that maximize generality under moment constraints present in the training data. Ludwig Boltzmann's original derivation of a system's equilbirium energy distribution is presented as a first application of the MaxEnt principle. The Boltzmann distribution is then used as a starting point for energy-based models (EBM) and generative models using energy-based methods. Entropy maximization is then presented in the context of the free energy functional used in Bayesian variational inference.
